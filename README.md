# 🔍 Real-Time Face Recognition using Python and OpenCV

This is a real-time face recognition system built using the powerful [`face_recognition`](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) library and OpenCV. It can detect and recognize faces using a webcam and match them with a preloaded set of known images.

---

## 📸 Features

* Real-time face detection via webcam
* Face recognition with name labeling
* Supports multiple known faces
* Simple and efficient using deep learning models under the hood

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```
face_recognition_project/
│
├── known_faces/           # Folder containing known face images (e.g., john.jpg, alice.png)
├── face_recognition.py    # Main Python script
└── README.md              # This documentation file
```

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the following packages before running the project:

```bash
pip install face_recognition opencv-python numpy
```

You may also need to install **dlib** if it doesn't come preinstalled with `face_recognition`. For Windows, it's recommended to install via a precompiled wheel or use Anaconda.

---

## 📷 How to Use

1. **Prepare known faces:**

   * Place images of known people in the `known_faces/` directory.
   * File names (without extension) will be used as labels (e.g., `john_doe.jpg` → "john\_doe").

2. **Run the script:**

```bash
python face_recognition.py
```

3. **Exit the app:**

   * Press the **`q`** key to stop webcam and close the window.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* Loads and encodes faces from `known_faces/`.
* Captures webcam frames in real time.
* Detects and encodes faces in the current frame.
* Compares unknown faces to known encodings using Euclidean distance.
* Labels the face with the best match (or "Unknown").

---

## 📌 Notes

* The frame is resized to 1/4 for faster processing.
* Matching uses `face_recognition.compare_faces()` and `face_distance()` to find the best match.
* The known images should have clear, front-facing views of the face.

## 🚀 Example

**Input:**

Images like `elon_musk.jpg` or `taylor_swift.png` in the `known_faces` directory.

**Output:**

A webcam feed showing recognized faces with name labels.
